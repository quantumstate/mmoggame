Resource fields are a very important part of the game and without more resources you will not progress. There are 5 types of resources - wood, stone, bronze, wheat and coin. Every resource is needed for making buildings, units and resource fields. Coin is also used for hiring mercenaries, and paying for troops. To build a resource field, simply click on the number on one of the fields and click build to build it.
