<h4>
Introduction
</h4>
</br>Welcome to the instructions. These will enable users to get to know the game interface, the objects of the game, and will give advice to maintain a fun and friendly environment.</p>
<h4>
Object Of Game
</h4>
</br>
The object of the game is to become the greatest player in the ancient mediterranean world, the only player left out of all the players who started out on the server. This takes a long time, and depending on how many players are on the server at the close of registration can take from a couple of months, to a year. This may sound like a long time, but to play the game you only need a minimum of 5 minutes or so a day to play. There will be players who spend much longer than you,and inevitably these players will be stronger than you but as there are no specific victory conditions, there is no one 'winner.' You can set yourself targets, to reach 2000 population for example or to defeat your neighbour or destroy another alliance. The choice is yours!!!
